This repository wanna add annotation behaviors, such as mark, comment, like, 
confuse to the original PubReader, to the NCBI/PubReader repository.
With it, you can mark text, comment in lines, and share your emotions.
To try it out, simply clone the repository to a directory on your pc:

    git clone https://github.com/xiongzhp/PubReader.git

And then, in your browser, open `PubReader/test/test-article2.html`, 
which is adapted from the origin test page `PubReader/test/test-article1.html` in NCBI/PubReader repository, 
and you can see the changes if you select some text of the page.
One of the dominante bugs is that all of your marks would disappear when you have marked many places and just wanna delete one of them.
Hope someone would fix it.
